# Magic-Cardmarket-Spider

A scrapy-powered spider that parses all the 'single card' magic card advertisements on CardMarket.

## Prerequisites

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You will need to install some libs in order to run any spider. To install them, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also will need to install docker && docker-compose.

## Run the project

Before executing anything, keep in mind that this execution may take days:

```bash
docker-compose up -d

cd magic

scrapy crawl mkm
```

If your system (I assume it is UNIX) does not recognize the command "scrapy" add it to your path:

```bash
PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/.local/bin"
```
